<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The major United States public transit systems contribute significantly to individuals daily transportation, allowing commuters alternative and often more affordable transit options for commutes. The goal of this project is to explore different characteristics of the major transit systems in the United States, based on data from the <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd">National Transit Database</a>. More specifically, the analysis includes data from the <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2022-annual-database-fare-revenues">2022 Fare Revenue</a> table, the most recent <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/monthly-module-adjusted-data-release">Monthly Ridership</a> table, and the <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2022-operating-expenses">2022 Operating Expenses</a> reports. This report intends to consider various statistics including farebox recovery, ridership, total trips, total vehicle miles traveled, total revenues and expenses for various locations and transit agencies, to analyze the performance of these transit systems over time. Ultimately, the analysis of certain metrics will assist in determining the most efficient transit system in the United States.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-cleaning">Data Cleaning</h2>
<p>Before starting the analysis, the relevant data files need to be loaded and cleaned into data frames on R. Below consists of the code required to download the data files and create the relevant data frames by merging different tables. From the original data files four data frames are created: <code>FARES</code>, <code>EXPENSES</code>, <code>TRIPS</code>, and <code>MILES</code>. Following this, <code>FARES</code> and <code>EXPENSES</code> are merged into the <code>FINANCIALS</code> data frame and <code>TRIPS</code> and <code>MILES</code> are merged into the <code>USAGE</code> data frame. From this point forward, only the <code>USAGE</code> and <code>FINANCIALS</code> data frame will be necessary to conduct the analysis.</p>

<p>Prior to analyzing data, it is important to make data tables as clear as possible to ensure clarity and accurate interpretation of results. So, renaming the column <code>UZA Name</code> to <code>metro_area</code> clarifies that the column contains the location (city, state) of the transit systems.</p>

</div>
<p>Additionally, the <code>Mode</code> column contains some abbreviated codes, so converting these codes into understandable terms is helpful for future analysis.</p>

<p>The code below is used help to streamline the process of converting the codes into the terms, by showing the unique codes in the <code>Mode</code> column. Ultimately making the process of searching for these terms in the <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/national-transit-database-ntd-glossary">National Transit Database (NTD) Glossary</a> much more efficient.</p>

<p>Furthermore, to clean up the data table even more, the removal of columns <code>NTD ID</code> and <code>3 Mode</code> could help clear unnecessary information before analysis.

For this, a new data table <code>USAGE_clean</code> is created, shown below.</p>

<p>The transit agency that had the most total vehicle revenue miles in the sample was MTA New York City Transit, with a total of <code>{r}transit_agency_max_total_VRM</code> vehicle revenue miles. Being that MTA New York City Transit is one of the largest transit systems in the entire world and the largest in the US, it is unsurprising that this transit agency had the most total VRM in the data set.</p>

<p>The transit mode with the most total vehicle revenue miles in this sample was the Bus, having a total of 4.9444494^{10} vehicle revenue miles. Buses make up a large portion of public transportation, especially in cities that donâ€™t have heavy rail trains like NYC, so it is reasonable that buses had the most vehicle revenue miles.</p>

<p>There were 1.8045882^{8} total trips taken on the New York City Subway in May 2024. From the data table <code>total_trips_NYC_subway_2024</code>, the average monthly ridership from January 2024 to April 2024, was less than that of May 2024. This could be attributed to the season change, as the weather gets warmer from Winter into the Spring.</p>

<p>From April 2019 to April 2020, the NYC subway ridership fell by 2.1196966^{8}. The drastic drop in NYC subway ridership was likely due to the COVID-19 global pandemic which forced everyone to remain indoors and socially distance from others. So, it is understandable that such an extreme drop of 2.1196966^{8} occurred.</p>
<p>After analyzing the above statistics from the monthly ridership table, I wanted to find some additional information on the possible impact of COVID-19 on transit system ridership in the US.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transit-system-patterns-before-and-during-covid-19-analysis">Transit System Patterns Before and During COVID-19 Analysis</h3>
<p>Several years ago, in 2020, the world experienced a global outbreak of COVID-19, impacting local and international economies. This event encouraged social distancing and prevented any significant travel for citizens besides essential workers. I was curious to see how our national transit systems were affected by this global event. More specifically, I wanted to explore the ridership changes for the various metro areas included in the national ridership data set. I created a data frame with the total ridership of each metro area in this time frame, then calculated the percent change of ridership from 2019 to 2020. I expected to find a decrease in ridership in all the cities from 2019 to 2020 and wanted to explore which cities were negatively impacted the most and least.</p>

<p>After looking through the data, I found that the city with the greatest ridership drop from 2019 to 2020 was Rome, GA with a percentage change of -91.56%.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I wanted to explore more about the ridership in Rome, GA and analyze the breakdown of ridership by mode of transportation.</p>

<p>Although finding an increase in ridership from 2019 to 2020 is not entirely impossible, it was probably unlikely to occur. So, it was important to do additional investigation to figure out why these calculations came out to be positive.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Upon further review of the data for Victoria, TX, it is apparent that no data was collected between January 2019 to August 2019, causing the total ridership for 2019 to be significantly lower than the totals from 2020.</p>

<p>The total for Victoria, TX in 2019 was 1.07199^{5} compared to 2020 with a total of 2.69979^{5}, a significant difference due to the missing data from 2019. Being that the information for 2019 is not entirely accessible, it is inconclusive whether the ridership in Victoria, TX increased or decreased from 2019 to 2020.</p>
<p>Contrary to Victoria, TX, the data for Las Cruces, NM was not nearly as drastic. Although, there seems to be an inconsistency in the total ridership for January 2019.</p>

<p>From the table above, Las Cruces, NM, experienced a total ridership of 532, which seems highly unlikely given that the range of values for the remainder of 2019 were between 4510 and 9544. Observing the remaining data points, thereâ€™s a general increase in ridership from January 2019 until about January 2020, the Las Cruces, NM metro area experiences a steep ridership drop in April 2020, right around the peak of the pandemic. Overall, it seems that the ridership from January 2019 may have been undercounted, so it is unclear whether Las Cruces, NM experienced an increase or decrease in ridership from 2019 to 2020.</p>
<p>Lastly, for Port St.&nbsp;Lucie, FL, there is less of a concern for the 2019 data as the monthly ridership totals seem to fluctuate in the range of 14,000 to 18,000. However, in 2020, there is a noticeable increase in ridership in October 2020.</p>

<p>In September 2019, Port St.&nbsp;Lucie, FL experienced a ridership total of 6883. In only one month, Port St.&nbsp;Lucie, FL increased its ridership by 4.3535^{4} (or 633%) to a total ridership in October 2020 of 5.0418^{4}. While this seems a little unbelievable, it is possible that during the latter part of 2020, people were beginning to travel domestically again. Perhaps more people were fleeing bigger urban areas for smaller cities like Port St.&nbsp;Lucie, FL causing a spike in ridership in October 2020 and beyond. In this case there is more believability especially since the ridership in Port St.&nbsp;Lucie, FL after October 2020 maintained this high total ridership fluctuating between 46,000 and 52,000 UPT.</p>
<p>Although in certain cases, it is unlikely that ridership would have increased from 2019 to 2020, it is possible that certain, more suburban, areas could have had an increase in ridership. One possibility is that people wanted to relocate from more densely populated cities into smaller cities, when travel became more accessible, causing an increase in ridership in cities like Port St.&nbsp;Lucie, FL.</p>

<p>Aside from the above three cities, the large majority of US city transit systems experienced a decrease in ridership. Being that New York City has the largest transit system in the United States, the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA), I was curious to further analyze the changes the cityâ€™s transit system experienced from 2019 to 2020.</p>

<p>As expected, all 5 modes of transportation (bus, bus rapid transit, commuter bus, demand response, and heavy rail) contributed to the overall -56% change in ridership in NYC from 2019 to 2020. During this time, many companies transitioned to remote work allowing employees to work from home and all students transitioned to virtual learning, avoiding travel and public transportation. Additionally, the fear of contracting and spreading the virus led more individuals who needed to travel to use personal vehicles rather than public transport. All of these factors contributed to the severe decrease in ridership in NYCâ€™s transit system.</p>

<section id="conclusion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Transit system efficiency is subjective and can be measured with different metrics (highest UPT, highest farebox recovery, lowest expenses per UPT, highest total fares per UPT, lowest expenses per VRM, and highest total fares per VRM). Based on the above information, using the farebox recovery ratio, I found that the most efficient transit system in the country in 2022 was the Ferryboat from the Port Imperial Ferry Corporation. This transit system was able to maximize its total fares while minimizing their expenses leading to the highest farebox recovery ratio.</p>
<p>Overall, the <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd">National Transit Database</a> provided a lot of useful and insightful data, allowing for a wide range of analysis. Through these data, it was interesting to explore historical transit data leading to thought-provoking insights as well as the various metrics to determine effective and efficient transportation in the United States. As the world continues to accelerate post-COVID, the major US public transit systems will continue to improve and create more efficient means of transportation for commuters around the nation.</p>
