<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction:</h2>
<p>For this project, the goal is to explore different characteristics of the major public transit systems in the United States, based on data from the <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd">National Transit Database</a>. More specifically, the analysis includes data from the <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2022-annual-database-fare-revenues">2022 Fare Revenue</a> table, the most recent <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/monthly-module-adjusted-data-release">Monthly Ridership</a> table, and the <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2022-operating-expenses">2022 Operating Expenses</a> reports. By analyzing various statistics like the total amount of trips, total vehicle miles traveled, total revenues and expenses by source, I hope to answer various questions and determine the most efficient transit system in the United States.</p>

<section id="data-cleaning" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-cleaning">Data Cleaning</h2>
<p>Before starting the analysis, the relevant data files need to be loaded and cleaned into data frames on R. Below consists of the code required to download the data files and create the relevant data frames by merging different tables. From the original data files four data frames are created: <code>FARES</code>, <code>EXPENSES</code>, <code>TRIPS</code>, and <code>MILES</code>. Following this, <code>FARES</code> and <code>EXPENSES</code> are merged into the <code>FINANCIALS</code> data frame and <code>TRIPS</code> and <code>MILES</code> are merged into the <code>USAGE</code> data frame. From this point forward, only the <code>USAGE</code> and <code>FINANCIALS</code> data frame will be necessary to conduct the analysis.</p>

<p>From April 2019 to April 2020, the NYC subway ridership fell by 2.1196966^{8}.</p>

<p>After analyzing the above statistics from the monthly ridership table, I wanted to find some additional information.</p>

<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="question-1">Question #1:</h4>
<p>Several years ago, in 2020, the world experienced a global outbreak of COVID-19, impacting local and international economies. This event encouraged social distancing and prevented any significant travel for citizens besides essential workers. I was curious to see how our national transit systems were affected by this global event. More specifically, I wanted to explore the ridership changes for the various metro areas included in the national ridership data set. I created a data frame with the total ridership of each metro area in this time frame, then calculated the percent change of ridership from 2019 to 2020. I expected to find a decrease in ridership in all the cities from 2019 to 2020 and wanted to explore which cities were negatively impacted the most and least.</p>

<p>After looking through the data, I found that the city with the greatest ridership drop from 2019 to 2020 was Rome, GA with a percentage change of -91.56%.</p>
<p>I wanted to explore more about the ridership in Rome, GA and analyze the breakdown of ridership by mode of transportation.</p>

<p>From this table above, I observed that there were only two recorded modes of transportation from Rome, GA: bus and demand response. The bus ridership changed by -92.75 %, while the demand response ridership changed by -36.57 %.</p>
<p>Additionally, I was curious to see which city’s ridership was impacted the least.</p>

<p>When exploring this question, contrary to my original assumption, I found that there were multiple cities that actually <strong>increased</strong> their ridership from 2019 to 2020. These cities were Las Cruces, NM, Port St. Lucie, FL, Victoria, TX. The city with the lowest ridership drop (with an increase in ridership) was Victoria, TX with a percent change of +151.85%.</p>
<p>I curious about which mode of transportation contributed to the increase in ridership in Victoria, TX from 2019 to 2020.</p>

<p>There was an increase in ridership for all modes of transportation recorded in Victoria, TX. Bus had percent change of +189.41%. Commuter bus had a percent change of +123.64%. While demand response had a percent change of +88.52%. All three modes of transportation contributed to the overall increase of ridership in Victoria, TX from 2019 to 2020.</p>
<p>Being that New York City has one of the largest transit systems in the world and the largest in the United States, the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA), I was curious to see the changes the city’s transit system experienced from 2019 to 2020.</p>

<p>Lastly, Chicago Water Taxi (Wendella) had the highest total fares per VRM in 2022.</p>
<p>Transit System efficiency is subjective and can be measured with different metrics (highest UPT, highest farebox recovery, lowest expenses per UPT, highest total fares per UPT, lowest expenses per VRM, and highest total fares per VRM). Based on the above information, using the farebox recovery ratio, I found that the most efficient transit system in the country in 2022 was the <strong>Transit Authority of Central Kentucky</strong> with a mode of transportation of <strong>Vanpool</strong>. This transit system was able to maximize its total fares while minimizing their expenses leading to the highest farebox recovery ratio.</p>
