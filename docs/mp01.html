<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>For this project, the goal is to explore different characteristics of the major transit systems in the United States, based on data from the <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd">National Transit Database</a>. More specifically, the analysis includes data from the <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2022-annual-database-fare-revenues">2022 Fare Revenue</a> table, the most recent <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/monthly-module-adjusted-data-release">Monthly Ridership</a> table, and the <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/data-product/2022-operating-expenses">2022 Operating Expenses</a> reports. By analyzing various statistics like the total amount of trips, total vehicle miles traveled, total revenues and expenses by source, I hope to answer various questions and determine the most efficient transit system in the United States.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-cleaning" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-cleaning">Data Cleaning</h2>
<p>Before starting the analysis, the relevant data files need to be loaded and cleaned into data frames on R. Below consists of the code required to download the data files and create the relevant data frames by merging different tables. From the original data files four data frames are created: <code>FARES</code>, <code>EXPENSES</code>, <code>TRIPS</code>, and <code>MILES</code>. Following this, <code>FARES</code> and <code>EXPENSES</code> are merged into the <code>FINANCIALS</code> data frame and <code>TRIPS</code> and <code>MILES</code> are merged into the <code>USAGE</code> data frame. From this point forward, only the <code>USAGE</code> and <code>FINANCIALS</code> data frame will be necessary to conduct the analysis.</p>

<p>Prior to analyzing data, it is important to make data tables as clear as possible to ensure clarity and accurate interpretation of results. So, renaming the column <code>UZA Name</code> to <code>metro_area</code> clarifies that the column contains the location (city, state) of the transit systems.</p>

</div>
<p>Additionally, the <code>Mode</code> column contains some abbreviated codes, so converting these codes into understandable terms is helpful for future analysis.</p>

<p>The code below is used help to streamline the process of converting the codes into the terms, by showing the unique codes in the <code>Mode</code> column. Ultimately making the process of searching for these terms in the <a href="https://www.transit.dot.gov/ntd/national-transit-database-ntd-glossary">National Transit Database (NTD) Glossary</a> much more efficient.</p>

<p>Furthermore, to clean up the data table even more, the removal of columns <code>NTD ID</code> and <code>3 Mode</code> could help clear unnecessary information before analysis.

For this, a new data table <code>USAGE_clean</code> is created, shown below.</p>

<p>The transit agency that had the most total vehicle revenue miles in the sample was MTA New York City Transit, with a total of <code>{r}transit_agency_max_total_VRM</code> vehicle revenue miles. Being that MTA New York City Transit is one of the largest transit systems in the entire world and the largest in the US, it is unsurprising that this transit agency had the most total VRM in the data set.</p>

<p>The transit mode with the most total vehicle revenue miles in this sample was the Bus, having a total of 4.9444494^{10} vehicle revenue miles. Buses make up a large portion of public transportation, especially in cities that don’t have heavy rail trains like NYC, so it is reasonable that buses had the most vehicle revenue miles.</p>

<p>There were 1.8045882^{8} total trips taken on the New York City Subway in May 2024. From the data table <code>total_trips_NYC_subway_2024</code>, the average monthly ridership from January 2024 to April 2024, was less than that of May 2024. This could be attributed to the season change, as the weather gets warmer from Winter into the Spring.</p>

<p>From April 2019 to April 2020, the NYC subway ridership fell by 2.1196966^{8}. The drastic drop in NYC subway ridership was likely due to the COVID-19 global pandemic which forced everyone to remain indoors and socially distance from others. So, it is understandable that such an extreme drop of 2.1196966^{8} occurred.</p>
<p>After analyzing the above statistics from the monthly ridership table, I wanted to find some additional information on the possible impact of COVID-19 on transit system ridership in the US.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="transit-system-patterns-before-and-during-covid-19-analysis">Transit System Patterns Before and During COVID-19 Analysis</h3>
<p>Several years ago, in 2020, the world experienced a global outbreak of COVID-19, impacting local and international economies. This event encouraged social distancing and prevented any significant travel for citizens besides essential workers. I was curious to see how our national transit systems were affected by this global event. More specifically, I wanted to explore the ridership changes for the various metro areas included in the national ridership data set. I created a data frame with the total ridership of each metro area in this time frame, then calculated the percent change of ridership from 2019 to 2020. I expected to find a decrease in ridership in all the cities from 2019 to 2020 and wanted to explore which cities were negatively impacted the most and least.</p>

<p>After looking through the data, I found that the city with the greatest ridership drop from 2019 to 2020 was Rome, GA with a percentage change of -91.56%.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I wanted to explore more about the ridership in Rome, GA and analyze the breakdown of ridership by mode of transportation.</p>

<p>From this table above, there were only two recorded modes of transportation from Rome, GA: bus and demand response. The bus ridership changed by -92.75 %, while the demand response ridership changed by -36.57%.</p>
<p>Subsequently, I was curious to see which city was affected the least.</p>

<p>When exploring this question, contrary to my original assumption, I found that there were multiple cities that actually <strong>increased</strong> their ridership from 2019 to 2020. These cities were Las Cruces, NM, Port St. Lucie, FL, Victoria, TX. The city with the lowest ridership drop (in other words, with the highest increase in ridership) was Victoria, TX with a percent change of +151.85%.</p>
<p>I curious about which mode of transportation contributed to the increase in ridership in Victoria, TX from 2019 to 2020.</p>

<p>There was an increase in ridership for all modes of transportation recorded in Victoria, TX. Bus had percent change of +189.41%. Commuter bus had a percent change of +123.64%. While demand response had a percent change of +88.52%. All three modes of transportation contributed to the overall increase of ridership in Victoria, TX from 2019 to 2020.</p>
<p>Although it seems unlikely that ridership would have increased from 2019 to 2020, it is possible that certain, more suburban, areas could have had an increase in ridership. One possibility is that people wanted to relocate from more densely populated cities into smaller cities, causing an increase in ridership in Las Cruces, NM, Port St. Lucie, FL, Victoria, TX.</p>
<p>Aside from the above three cities, the large majority of US city transit systems experienced a decrease in ridership. Being that New York City has the largest transit system in the United States, the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA), I was curious to further analyze the changes the city’s transit system experienced from 2019 to 2020.</p>

<p>As expected, all 5 modes of transportation (bus, bus rapid transit, commuter bus, demand response, and heavy rail) contributed to the overall decrease in ridership in NYC from 2019 to 2020. During this time, many companies transitioned to remote work allowing employees to work from home, avoiding travel and public transportation. Additionally, all students transitioned to remote learning allowing for virtual connection to classrooms. Both these factors contributed to the severe decrease in ridership in NYC’s transit system.</p>

<p>Since the focus of the remaining analysis is on the financials and ridership of the US major transit systems in 2022, the table <code>USAGE</code> must be filtered for data in 2022 and then merged with the <code>FINANCIALS</code> table from earlier. Additionally, to filter for major transit systems, the new table <code>USAGE_AND_FINANCIALS</code> table is filtered to only contain data with total unlinked passenger trips greater than 400,000.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Transit system efficiency is subjective and can be measured with different metrics (highest UPT, highest farebox recovery, lowest expenses per UPT, highest total fares per UPT, lowest expenses per VRM, and highest total fares per VRM). Based on the above information, using the farebox recovery ratio, I found that the most efficient transit system in the country in 2022 was the **Ferryboat** from the **Port Imperial Ferry Corporation**. This transit system was able to maximize its total fares while minimizing their expenses leading to the highest farebox recovery ratio.</p>
