    "text": "Hello everyone, my name is Elissa!\nI am a curious graduate student at Baruch College with a passion for problem solving and tackling challenges through new experiences. Iâ€™m currently pursuing a Master of Science in Business Analytics with a concentration in Data Analytics in the Zicklin School of Business.\nI am also a recent graduate of Baruch College from the Baruch Scholars Honors program where I obtained a Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics and minored in Communication Studies.\n13 years ago, I discovered my first passion. Basketball has been a large part of my life for as long as I can remember. I have grown significantly since then, adapting to new team environments, learning to become a leader, and overcoming challenges. Four years ago, I was able to live out my dream of playing at the collegiate level for the Baruch Bearcats.\nThree summers ago, I tried something new and different. I had the opportunity of being a Microsoft Data Science Research fellow. Using R, I researched hands-on with large data sets, developed regression models, and created visualizations to analyze data. By the end of this program, I successfully collaborated on a research replication project, analyzing the effects of socioeconomic and mobility factors on Covid-19 positivity rates in New York City. Through this opportunity I found a new passion for data science, a bridge between my interests in mathematics and programming.\nAll these experiences have provided me with foundational skills to foster development in both my personal and professional growth. I hope to continue to explore all my passions and gain new experiences during my pursuit of data science and data analytics careers."
